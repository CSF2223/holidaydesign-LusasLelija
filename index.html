            <h2>Dead Horse Caroling</h2>
            <h4><em>Wales</em></h4>
            <img src="ChooseThree/DeadHorseCaroling.webp"></img>
            <p>You’re probably familiar with Christmas caroling, but you’re definitely not familiar with the carolers who might show up at your door in Wales. At some point in December or January, you could open your door to find someone hidden by a ribbon and bell-adorned sheet, holding up a real horse skull on a stick, with a few fellow revelers in tow. As part of this Mari Lwyd (“Gray Mare”) tradition, the group will sing to you and then challenge you to a battle of rhyming insults in Welsh (called a pwnco). After the contest, the party is usually invited inside for refreshments.</p>

            <h2>Krampus</h2>
            <h4><em>Germany, Austria, Hungary</em></h4>

            <p>Santa’s worse half is a hairy, devil-like creature called Krampus. Legend has it that while Santa brings toys to “nice” children, Krampus’ job is to punish kids on the “naughty” list. Mostly he just frightens the children with his beastly looks, but it’s said that he throws particularly bad children into his sack, or chains them up in his basket and carts them off to Hell. People in Austria and neighboring countries often dress up as Krampus in early December and wander the streets to scare children.</p>

            <h2>Yule Goat</h2>
            <h4><em>Scandinavia</em></h4>
            <img src="ChooseThree/YuleGoat.jpeg"> </img>
            <p>You’ve likely heard of a Yule log, but how about a Yule goat? Throughout Scandinavia, especially Sweden, Norway and Finland, locals celebrate a variation of the Santa Claus legend, which involves him riding a goat instead of a sleigh pulled by reindeer. As such, it’s common to find goat ornaments everywhere. Although the town of Gävle, Sweden does one better by erecting a larger-than-life straw goat in the town square (whose size has even made the Guinness Book of World Records). The goat structure is meant to last from Advent until New Year’s Day, but perhaps more noteworthy than its size is the annual unofficial sabotaging of said goat, since it inevitably gets burned to the ground more often than not.</p>
